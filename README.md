# :desktop_computer: CS Portfolio

This is where I track all of the achivements that I have done related to CS. I also use this site as a way to test new material that I have learned over the last 2 years. If you play around with this site enought you might be able to see a lot of hidden features. I try to make each project as polish as possible by making sure that everything is covered. 

Features covered in this site:

- Dark/Light mode
- Error page
- Responsive design, compatiable with small to extra large devices
- Proper meta tags to make site more satisfying when sharing

The site is only frontend and was created using: React.js and MUI (Material-UI)
